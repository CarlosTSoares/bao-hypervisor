# Bao - a lightweight static partitioning hypervisor

Bao source code under development for PCIe virtualization support.

In this project, we offer support for ITS virtualization. The GIC version used is the GICv3 and the injection of LPIs is done using List Registers. Additional support provide direct injection of LPIs using virtualization extensions of GICv4.
